## 📊 Techniques & Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Processes**:  
    - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
    - Feature Engineering  
    - Predictive Modeling

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**  
     Import flight, airline, and airport datasets from CSV files.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
     - Handle missing values.  
     - Drop irrelevant columns.  
     - Convert data types.  
     - Clean and preprocess categorical features.

3. **EDA**  
     - Create visualizations to identify trends and anomalies.  
     - Perform statistical summaries to understand data distributions.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
     - Extract meaningful features such as day of the week, delay types, cancellation reasons, and time-based patterns.

5. **Modeling**  
     - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to predict delays or cancellations.

6. **Evaluation**  
     - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## 📈 Insights

- **Delays**: More frequent during specific hours and months.  
- **Cancellations**: Often caused by weather and carrier-related issues.  
- **Key Predictors**: Time of day, flight distance, and carrier name significantly influence delays and cancellations.
